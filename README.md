This is the repo of the "epocutils" C/C++ helper dedicated to the Epoc headset.
Any updates on this project will be published here in the future.

Nb: the instance of 'EpocHeadset_t' used in 'main.cpp' is called 'Billy' in reference to Stan & his gran'pa ( South Park ) ;p

Note: next [ BIG ] update soon !

Enjoy !
